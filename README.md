California State University, Sacramento - Computer Science


CSC 35 - Fall 2022 - Devin Cook
  - Assembly Language - x86 - Intel Syntax
  - Easy subject.
  - In person but can do all the labs & final project remotely.
  - Attendance not mandatory but I'd recommend it.
  - Really nice, patient and a good professor who thoroughly teaches his subject.
  - 2 midterms and 1 final exam in person. Lenient Grader. 
  - 1 final project with 45 points of EC.
  - Confusing & odd wording for his exams.
  - I don't expect to need this subject in the future outside of school.
  - Just took the final, very challenging with A LOT of vocab (45 points worth), & 2 easy coding problems. If you focus on his study guide really well you should be fine. Easy class if you dont pass, it's because you didn't want to pass. The A is very achievable but the only thing that will hinder that are the midterms/final exam because those are the only semi challenging part of this course.
  - I'd take him again unless there was a professor who doesn't teach well but gives you the A with no effort. 


CSC 130 - Fall 2022 - Matthew W. Phillips
  - Objected oriented programming using Java - Basic 2D game dev.
  - Easy subject if you have Java experience.
  - Attendance not mandatory. 
  - In person but professor gives you the option to complete the course completely remote.
  - 2 Quizzes, 1 midterm, 1 final exam, all remote.
  - Easy quizzes and exams.
  - 1 final project.
  - Really nice and good professor who's best interest is his students success.
  - Would definitely take him again. 


CSC 131 - Fall 2022 - Ahmed Salem
  - Sofware Engineering in a team Environment.
  - You'll be working on a team project the entire semester.
  - Remote.
  - Attendance not mandatory but must meet with your group remotely to work/discuss project.
  - Very nice professor who seems to want the best for his students.
  - 1 midterm and 1 final. 
  - Exam wording is very very confusing but is open note.
  - Easy course & medium difficulty professor.
  - I'd recommend to quickly gather good group members as soon as the professor mentions it because a good group will either make or break your semester/grade.
  - Would take him again.
